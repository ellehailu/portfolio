		<h2>About me</h2> <!--this can include hobbies and interests-->
		<p>Hello! I’m glad you are here.

			My name is Elshadai but most people call me “Elle.” I am a <em>writer, researcher, content creator,</em> and
			<em>storyteller</em>. When I am not at my desk writing, you can find me outdoors hiking, paddleboarding,
			running or
			curled up on my couch with a cup of tea and a good book.

			This is a little look into who I am and what I do.
			Enjoy!
